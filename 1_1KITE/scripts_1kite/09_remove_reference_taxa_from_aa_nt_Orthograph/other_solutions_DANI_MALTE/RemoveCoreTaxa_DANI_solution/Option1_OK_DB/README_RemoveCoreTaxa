Remove Core Taxa
for aa files
1) Create file with the core taxa you like to remove:
	Open the script "RemoveCoreTaxa_DB.sh" and change the core taxa with the name you want to exclude
	copy the script "RemoveCoreTaxa_DB.sh" in the directory where your fasta files are
	run script: sh RemoveCoreTaxa_DB.sh
	output: is a textfile "header2remove.txt", with all headers from the core taxa you assigned in the .sh script
2) Remove all sequences you want to exclude with the script "multifastafilterNEW.pl"
	run perl script: for file in EOG*.fas; do perl multifastafilterNEW.pl -v header2remove.txt $file; done >TraceFile_aa.log
	output: fasta files, in which all core taxa are removed, which you assigned before (extension: .fas.filtered)
			TraceFile.log (output what the script does during the run)
3) Check if everything works well
	run command: grep -c "seq #" TraceFile_aa.log						# count all taxa, which are removed
				 grep ">" EOG*.linsi.aa.fas.filtered |wc -l			## count in filtered files all ">"
				 grep ">" EOG*.linsi.aa.fas |wc -l					## count in original files all ">"
				 
for nt files
1)	copy the text file "header2remove.txt" in the directory, where your nt files are
2) Remove all sequences you want to exclude with the script "multifastafilterNEW.pl"
	run perl script: for file in EOG*.fas; do perl multifastafilterNEW.pl -v header2remove.txt $file; done >TraceFile_nt.log
	output: fasta files, in which all core taxa are removed, which you assigned before (extension: .fas.filtered)
			TraceFile.log (output what the script does during the run)
3) Check if everything works well
	run command: grep -c "seq #" TraceFile_nt.log					# count all taxa, which are removed
				 grep ">" EOG*.nt.fas.filtered |wc -l				## count in filtered files all ">"
				 grep ">" EOG*.nt.fas |wc -l					## count in original files all ">"
