Remove Core Taxa

1) Create file with the core taxa you like to remove:
	Open the script "RemoveCoreTaxa_DB.sh" and change the core taxa with the name you want to exclude
	copy the script "RemoveCoreTaxa_DB.sh" in the directory where your fasta files are
	run script: sh RemoveCoreTaxa_DB.sh
	output: is a textfile "header2remove.txt", with all headers from the core taxa you assigned in the .sh script
2) Remove all sequences you want to exclude with the script "multifastafilterNEW.pl"
	run perl script: for file in EOG*.fas; do perl multifastafilterNEW.pl -v header2remove.txt $file; done >TraceFile.log
	output: fasta files, in which all core taxa are removed, which you assigned before (extension: .fas.filtered)
			TraceFile.log (output what the script does during the run)
3) Check if everything works well
	run command: grep -c "seq #" TraceFile.log		# count all taxa, which are removed
				 grep ">" EOG5B2R*.linsi.aa.fas.filtered |wc -l			## count in filtered files all ">"
				 grep ">" EOG5B2R*.linsi.aa.fas |wc -l					## count in original files all ">"
